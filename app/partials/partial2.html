<h1>Styleguide</h1>

<p id="styleguide_introduction">
  This styleguide is a catalogue of the visual design concepts and domain concepts included in the LearnZillion "library" product. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Visual design concepts are communicated in the product's "look". For example, the concept of "subdued text" may be communicated by a certain font weight and color. Domain concepts are communicated through the consistent application of visual design concepts. For example, the concept of a "resource type label" may be communicated by its identification with the visual design concept of "subdued text".
